# Diabetes Prediction using Random Forest

This Python notebook demonstrates the use of the Random Forest algorithm for predicting the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on several health-related features.

## Introduction

Diabetes is a prevalent chronic disease with a significant impact on public health. 
Early detection and prediction of diabetes can help individuals take preventive measures and manage their health effectively. 
This notebook showcases the application of the Random Forest machine learning algorithm for predicting diabetes based on various health-related features.

## Features

- **Diabetes Prediction:** Predict whether an individual is likely to have diabetes or not.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Prepare the dataset for model training.
- **Model Training:** Implement and train the Random Forest classifier.
- **Evaluation:** Assess the model's performance using relevant metrics.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be found in the repo itself. It includes features like age, BMI, blood pressure, glucose levels, etc.

## Model Training

The model training process is outlined in the notebook. It includes data preprocessing, model selection, and training. 
You can follow the step-by-step instructions provided to train the Random Forest classifier.

## Evaluation

The notebook presents the model's performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. 
These metrics help assess the quality of the predictions made by the model.
